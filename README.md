#🎄 Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository is my attempt at advent of code 2025, using Rust. 
This was my first time doing advent of code.

I solved nearly all of the problems on my own, except for a few:

- Day 9, Part 2: I spent a lot of time trying to come up with and implement different solutions, without success. I eventually researched polygon intersections and stumbled upon a clever and fairly simple solution.
- Day 10, Part 2: I tried implementing different recursive algorithms, but my initial approach was flawed. I did not want to resort to an external library like Z3. I researched how to solve this second part, found this [clever solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1pk87hl/2025_day_10_part_2_bifurcate_your_way_to_victory/), and went ahead and implemented it.

Overall, this was a great learning experience, and I learned new concepts such as Kruskal’s algorithm and Union-Find.
